in tailwind we should be using grid layout for the responsive and we should be using tracking-tight for letter spacing 


Most Important:-
creating root is the most important part

dark mode:-
the dark mode and light mode theme is so easy to apply in this framework

code quality:-
we can improve our code quality by decreasing the chunk of code like whe we will apply hover focus and all these effects it will lead to a chunk of code, now how we are going to handle it
then we grab all the classes that are applied in that element and we uses index.css and we write like this : 

@layer components{
    .(class that you have given to the grabbed property element){
        @apply (and paste in all the property without using brackets this is just for note writting)
    }
}

we can also use prr-build components instead of using the index method

now we are going to build a react(vite) using tailwind

all the dependencies are dev dependent not to be pushed in the github repository
